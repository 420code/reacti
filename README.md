# Reacti 
The Discord Reaction Role bot, that only requires 1 library.

### Install
Go ahead and download the rep, either with .zip or with Git.
Now you can go ahead and start a terminal on your PC, Mac or Linux.
Type `cd WhereThe/FolderIs`. (Of course type where you placed the map and not what I typed.)

Now, to install the one library you only need to type `npm install` in the terminal.
The terminal may give us errors, but if you got `+ discord.js@12.2.0` you're on the right way.
Go ahead and open the index.js file with your choice of IDE. (Visual Studio Code, Atom e.t.c)

### Setup
As you see at line 13, we have a .login() function. Write your token in it.
You should be done after you edited all the SELF_ROLE_CHANNEL, GUILD_ID, ROLE_1_ID and ROLE_2_ID stuff.
Change the emojis in the embed to your choice, and what ROLE_ID it should give upon reacting.
When you did that, run `node index.js` in the terminal.
Voila!
